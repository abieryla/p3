### P3: Lorem Ipsum and Random User Generator

#### Project Description

The purpose of project 3 (P3) is to create a Lorem Ipsum text generator and a Random User generator.
From the home page the user can select to generate Lorem Ipsum text or Random User information. Each
link will take them to a new page where they can enter the number of paragraphs (for Lorem Ipsum) or
the number of users (for Random User) they would like. There is some client-side validation using an
input box size limiting the character input to 2 since I have the Max number to be generated set at 
50. There is also server side validation checking to make sure that the characters are numbers between
1-50 and that no other characters were input. If a user enters an incorrect value a red error message 
will appear and the user can try again. In the Random User generator Fake names will automatically be 
generator but there is an optional check box for generating an email and/or an address for that Fake 
user. For this assignment I used packagist.org to download and install fzaninotto/faker to generate 
the fake users and ecrmnn/lorem for the Lorem Ipsum text. At the last moment I decided to try and use
Bootstrap for making my site look a little nicer.
